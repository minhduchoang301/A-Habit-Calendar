* ##### Not inputting a date when creating an event causes an IndexOutOfBounds Exception
    * Could likely be fixed with a try/catch when asked to input the date, 
    and the catch condition can send a message to the user to input a correct date. 
    
* ##### Entering characters instead of a date into Event Search and Event Creation causes a NumberFormatException
    *
